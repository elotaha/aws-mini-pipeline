# aws-mini-pipeline
This is a small, hands-on project to showcase some key data engineering concepts in a cloud-like environment. It’s simple but practical, designed to demonstrate what I can do in Python, cloud, and DevOps.

What you’ll find here : 

    - AWS Free Tier concepts – S3-like storage, a simulated Lambda function, and Terraform for Infrastructure as Code.

    - Python ETL/ELT – Read, process, and display CSV data.

    - Reproducibility – Everything is versioned and organized so it’s easy to follow and extend.

    - Interview-ready – A clear example of my hands-on skills in data pipelines, cloud basics, and DevOps practices.

Project structure

    - terraform/ – Placeholder for AWS infrastructure (S3 bucket).

    - lambda/ – Python scripts simulating AWS Lambda functions.

    - sample_data/ – Example CSV files to test the pipeline.
